title: "Open Source"
---

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about open-source. Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessible (anyone can watch, update, contribute and distribute the code as they see fit). It has become a movement and a way of working that reaches beyond software production.
